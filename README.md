# Arduino Push Notification
https://github.com/PRosenb/ArduinoPushNotification

This project implements a small solution to send push notifications from an `Arduino` based `ESP32` or `ESP8266` to 
your `Android` device.
It shows how to set up `AWS` with the `Serverless` framework, contains a small `Arduino` sample implementation and the
`Android` app that receives the push notification.

## Features
- `AWS` based backend solution
- Simple `Lambda` functions written in `node.js`
- Database configuration using `DynamoDB`
- `API Gateway` configuration
- `Android` app written in `Kotlin`
- `Arduino` example code for `ESP32` and `ESP8266`
- Good starting point for similar projects

## Components
- [Serverless configuration](serverless/serverless.yml)
- [Lambda functions](serverless/src/)
- [Android App](app)
- [Arduino Sample](ArduinoPushNotificationClient/src/main.cpp)

## Setup Instructions

### AWS
- Install `Serverless` according to their [Getting Started](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/) guide
- Give `Serverless` access to your `AWS` account by following the [AWS - Credentials](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/) guide
  - I recommend initially doing [Quick Setup](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/#quick-setup) in chapter [Using AWS Access Keys](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/#using-aws-access-keys)
  - Ignore the note about `self-signed certificate`, we don't need them for this setup
- Clone this repository
  - Open a command shell and navigate to your desired directory. The clone command will create a subfolder `ArduinoPushNotification` in it
  - Execute the git clone command `git clone git@github.com:PRosenb/ArduinoPushNotification.git`
- Deploy the `AWS` configuration
  - Inside of the repository directory structure, navigate to the the directory `serverless`
  - Don't forget to set the credentials environment variables if you haven't done yet (on Windows use `set`)
    - `export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="<your key id>"`
    - `export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="<your key>"`
  - Execute the deploy command `serverless deploy`
  - On success, it will print multiple links of the following type:  
    `https://xxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/xxxx`  
  - One of the links is a `GET` endpoint. That one is the easiest to test the setup with
    - Copy the `GET` endpoint link and put it in a browser
    - When it shows `error: "Missing installationId"`, deployment was successful
  - From one of the links, copy the part until and including `v1/`, you'll need it later

### Android App
- Download and install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- Clone this repository if you haven't done it
- Open `Android Studio`
  - Click Menu `File`->`Open...`
  - Choose the the directory ArduinoPushNotification and open it
- Open the file `app/build.gradle` and change the `applicationId` to your own
- Follow the instructions [Add Firebase to your Android project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup)
  - use `Option 1`
  - Follow the guide until `Step 3: Add a Firebase configuration file` including  
    `Add the Firebase Android configuration file to your app:`
  - Put the file `google-services.json` here: `app/google-services.json`
- Open the file `â€Žapp/src/main/java/ch/pete/arduinopushnotification/service/Registration.kt`
  - Set the variable `SERVER_URL` to your URL from the `AWS` setup
  - Remove the part after `v1/` and ensure it has a trailing `/`
- Install the app on your Android device with the `Run` button
- Check if it connects to the API correctly by tapping on `Register`
  - It should do an API call, show a generated `Installation Id` and change the button to `Unregister`

### Arduino Setup
- Install [PlatformIO IDE for Atom](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=atom)
- Open `Atom`
  - Click Menu `File`->`Open...` and choose the directory `ArduinoPushNotificationClient`
- Click the tick icon `Build` on the left to check if it builds
- Open the file `src/main/main.cpp`
  - Set the variable `PUSH_URL` to your `POST` URL from the `AWS` step that ends with `send`
  - set the variable `INSTALLATION_ID` to the value the app shows as `Installation Id`
- Connect your ESP32 or ESP8266 to your PC via `USB`
- Upload the code to it with the arrow icon `Upload`
- On success of all steps above it sends a push notification and the app receives it
